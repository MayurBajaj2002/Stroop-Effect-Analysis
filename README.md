# Stroop-Effect_Analysis
This project makes use of formal methods to analyse data and reach statistical conclusions. These methods include hypothesis proposition and hypothesis testing. The statistical test carried out was the two-tailed dependent t-test. Upon comparing it to the t-critical value, a conclusion was made and the confidence interval of the same was noted. 
The advantage of such systematic testing is that it helps us make ACCURATE DEDUCTIONS instead of rough estimates based on the trends observed in the data. This is particularly useful in social sciences and laboratory research. 
This project demonstrates my thorough understanding of the basics of descriptive and inferential statistics.
