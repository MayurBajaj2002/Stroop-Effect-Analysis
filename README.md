# Stroop-Effect_Analysis
This project is an example of how data analysts use statistical models and code to create systematic reports. 
Such systematic reporting and investigation is the heart and sole of the entire field of Big Data. 
Here we propose some questions for investigation. Using visualisation in jupyter notebooks we make logical conclusions.
In this project, I first make inferences and observations. I compute statistics like mean, median etc. then I take the test myself and 
check how it compares with computed statistics. You are free to try the same.
